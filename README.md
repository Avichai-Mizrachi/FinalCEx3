# FinalCEx3

This project consists of two C programs: `isort` and `txtfind`, each demonstrating fundamental string manipulation and search functionalities.

## Files

- **isort.c**: Implements an insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
- **txtfind.c**: Searches for lines or words in a text that match a given search term.

## Compilation

To compile the programs, ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`), then run:

```bash
make
```

This will produce two executables: isort and txtfind.

## Usage

### isort

After compilation, run the program using:

```bash
./isort
```

The program will prompt you to enter a sequence of integers, which it will then sort using the insertion sort algorithm.

## txtfind

Run the program using:

```bash
./txtfind
```

The program will prompt you to enter a text and a search term.
It will then display lines or words from the text that match the search term.
